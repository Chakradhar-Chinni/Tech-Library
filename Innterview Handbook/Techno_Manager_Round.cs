Managerial rounds are story-driven, not fact-driven.
Interviewers look for how you behave, how you think, and how you solve problems, not just what you know.
Follow STAR pattern: Situation, Task, Action, Result (pure tech. qns don't follow STAR format)

What not to do in Manager or Techno Manager Round
/******

 1. Don’t Give Generic or Vague Answers

 Avoid lines like “I always give my best”, “I am a team player”, “I work hard”.
 Always give a specific example (preferably STAR), even if question doesn’t explicitly ask.

 2. Don’t Bad-Mouth Your Current Company or Manager

 No complaints about workload, politics, culture, etc.
 Keep tone neutral and professional.

 3. Don’t Show Lack of Ownership

 Avoid sentences like:

   “That wasn’t my responsibility.”
   “The other team delayed it.”
 Even if others caused issues, focus on your corrective actions.

 4. Don’t Over-explain or Ramble

 Managerial rounds value clarity + structure.
 Keep answers structured; avoid story-telling without a point.

 5. Don’t Admit Skills You Can’t Defend

 If you claim something (“I know microservices deeply”), you must be ready for follow-ups.

 6. Don’t Sound Like You Only Code

 Manager wants:

   Planning
   Collaboration
   Communication
   Risk handling
   Ownership
 Avoid answers that only focus on coding tasks.

 7. Don’t Blame Teams or Processes

 Instead of blame → talk about alignment, communication, and mitigation steps.

 8. Don’t Avoid Talking About Failures

 Managers expect self-awareness.
 You can discuss failures → but show what you learned and changed.

 9. Don’t Answer Without Business Reasoning

 Show you understand:

   Priorities
   Impact
   Value delivered
 Not just technical execution.

 10. Don’t Skip STAR When It Matters

 Behavioural + ownership + leadership questions → use STAR for clarity.
 Technical decision + architecture reasoning → use CORED (Context → Options → Reasoning → Execution → Decision).

 11. Don’t Show Zero Curiosity

 If asked, “How would you improve this process?” → don’t say “it looks fine”.
 Managers want proactive mindset.

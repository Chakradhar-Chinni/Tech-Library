Behavioural interviews assess how you’ve handled situations in the past to predict how you’ll act in the future.
Past behaviour is the best predictor of future performance.
  

Answer all questions in STAR format
S - Situation
T - Task 
A - Action 
R - Result

Describe the situation and the task. Exmplain what action was taken, result of the action
Communicate in positive approach (avoid negative or blaming scenario)
~2 mins long
Outcome-focused
With measurable impact (e.g., “reduced time by 30%”, “saved $90K/year”)


 Most behavioural questions are variants of the same 8–10 themes. 
| Category                | What They Look For               | Example Questions                                                                     |

| **Teamwork**            | Collaboration, empathy           | “Tell me about a time you worked with a difficult teammate.”                          |
| **Ownership**           | Accountability                   | “Describe a time you took full responsibility for a failure.”                         |
| **Problem-Solving**     | Analytical skills                | “Share an example of a complex problem you solved.”                                   |
| **Leadership**          | Initiative, influence            | “Tell me about a time you led without formal authority.”                              |
| **Adaptability**        | Flexibility                      | “Describe a situation where you had to learn something new quickly.”                  |
| **Conflict Management** | Handling differences             | “Tell me about a conflict and how you resolved it.”                                   |
| **Time Management**     | Prioritization                   | “How do you manage competing deadlines?”                                              |
| **Communication**       | Clarity, tone, stakeholder mgmt. | “Give an example of how you explained a technical concept to a non-technical person.” |


Example of properly answering:

Basic
“We had an issue and fixed it.
  
Good
“I helped fix the issue by checking logs.”

Excellent
“I identified the root cause using log analysis, fixed the issue, and implemented a retry mechanism reducing outages by 80%.”


**Teamwork** 
Handling a Conflict Within the Team
/*
Situation:
S1. During a high-priority automation project, two developers in my team disagreed on the approach — one wanted a script-based method while the other pushed for API integration.

S2. During our project sprint, two teammates had conflicting opinions on how to handle data validation

Task:
S1. As the technical lead, it was my responsibility to resolve the conflict quickly without affecting delivery.

S2. As the module owner, I had to resolve the conflict quickly while keeping both members engaged and ensuring the final solution was technically sound.


Action:
S1. I organized a short sync call where both explained their logic. We compared the pros and cons of each method, focusing on long-term maintainability instead of personal preference. I then proposed a hybrid approach: using API integration for core logic and scripts for quick configuration.

S2. I scheduled a short discussion where both explained their perspectives. Instead of focusing on who was right, I redirected the conversation toward our project goals — maintainability, performance, and reusability. I then proposed that we prototype both approaches with sample data and compare performance metrics. After the quick test, we saw that doing validations at the database layer reduced response time by 15%.

Result:
S1. The conflict was resolved in under a day, the hybrid solution reduced development time by 20%, and both developers appreciated that their ideas were valued — improving team trust significantly./

S2. We adopted the optimized solution, completed the module on time, and both teammates appreciated the fair decision-making approach. It also set a healthy precedent — later, the team started resolving disagreements through quick experiments instead of long debates.

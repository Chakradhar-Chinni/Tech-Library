Behavioural interviews assess how you’ve handled situations in the past to predict how you’ll act in the future.
Past behaviour is the best predictor of future performance.
  

Answer all questions in STAR format
S - Situation
T - Task 
A - Action 
R - Result

Describe the situation and the task. Exmplain what action was taken, result of the action
Communicate in positive approach (avoid negative or blaming scenario)
~2 mins long
Outcome-focused
With measurable impact (e.g., “reduced time by 30%”, “saved $90K/year”)


 Most behavioural questions are variants of the same 8–10 themes.

Example of properly answering:

Basic
“We had an issue and fixed it.
  
Good
“I helped fix the issue by checking logs.”

Excellent
“I identified the root cause using log analysis, fixed the issue, and implemented a retry mechanism reducing outages by 80%.”


**Teamwork**

Handling a Conflict Within the Team
Situation:
S1. During a high-priority automation project, two developers in my team disagreed on the approach — one wanted a script-based method while the other pushed for API integration.

S2. During our project sprint, two teammates had conflicting opinions on how to handle data validation

Task:
S1. As the technical lead, it was my responsibility to resolve the conflict quickly without affecting delivery.

S2. As the module owner, I had to resolve the conflict quickly while keeping both members engaged and ensuring the final solution was technically sound.


Action:
S1. I organized a short sync call where both explained their logic. We compared the pros and cons of each method, focusing on long-term maintainability instead of personal preference. I then proposed a hybrid approach: using API integration for core logic and scripts for quick configuration.

S2. I scheduled a short discussion where both explained their perspectives. Instead of focusing on who was right, I redirected the conversation toward our project goals — maintainability, performance, and reusability. I then proposed that we prototype both approaches with sample data and compare performance metrics. After the quick test, we saw that doing validations at the database layer reduced response time by 15%.

Result:
S1. The conflict was resolved in under a day, the hybrid solution reduced development time by 20%, and both developers appreciated that their ideas were valued — improving team trust significantly./

S2. We adopted the optimized solution, completed the module on time, and both teammates appreciated the fair decision-making approach. It also set a healthy precedent — later, the team started resolving disagreements through quick experiments instead of long debates.



  
Can you share an instance where you went over and above to help a team member?
  - team mate lacking tech skill, so trained him on weekends and helped to become upto speed. Since, outside of business hours we informed manager also.
Tell me about a time when your team achieved a significant goal.
   - migration from 3rd party tool to .net solution with in a 3 month time to avoid licensing cost.

Share an example of when you had to adapt to a team member’s working style.
  - clients/ Product owner preferred only meeting rather that email. so, scheduled recurring calls and demoed daily progress, updates. at end decreased re-work items as client is aware of end product.
  
How have you handled a situation where a team member was not pulling their weight?
  - team mate not pulling due to lack of prioritization skill, I helped to stay organized & prioritized eventually he became back to normal.

Can you give an example of a time when your team disagreed with your decision, and how did you manage it?
  - I proposed to handling logic calculation at db, other team mates had proposed with in app. I suggested for POC. mine is 2s, team mate is 3s. We refined further, and picked hybrid       approach, & time is 1s. this way I maintained team morale & ensured others are heard.
    
How have you handled personality clashes in your team? or Junior vs Senior crash
  - one member shares very strong opinions, 2nd member couldn't speak up as the 1st guy is making so strong gestures. I proposed round table approach so everyone speaks. Later, 1st member realized he was cutting off. becaused of shared discussions project issues have decreased by 30%
    
Talk about a time when you had to motivate a demotivated team member.
    - because of ever changing requirements work of a dev1 was not used, he felt demotivated. I had private talk and said to store all work as future enhancements. In later sprints, it got used. team morale is also increased

**Ownership**
/*
Can you provide an example of when a project or an idea you initiated benefited your team or organization?
Describe a time when you volunteered to expand your knowledge at work, without being asked.

Talk about a project or task you started on your own initiative.
Tell me a situation when you saw some problem and took the initiative to correct it rather than waiting for someone else to do it.
Can you detail a situation when you had to go above your normal duties to get a job done?
Share an instance where your self-motivation helped you achieve a professional goal.
Describe a time when you stayed motivated despite a challenging work situation or environment.

Angular 16 is used for this course. Released in 2023

old web frameworks : click on "add to cart" . webPage refreshes and loads everything again
modern frameworks: cart gets updated without much changes


<h2>
routing takes care of such things
component - a web page item 
angular application would have hierarchies, like many child scenarios



<h2>
Type Script is used for its type safety.

Type sctipt:
let name : string;
let age : int;

let name
let age


Javascript doesn't provide typesafety, but TS does



<h2> Major Typescript components
Static Typing
Interfaces
Class Properties
Public/Private accessibility
